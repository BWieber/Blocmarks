<h1> How to Use Blocmarks </h1>

<p> Blocmarks relies heavily on the Mailgun API to store and create bookmark data. While you can create topics and bookmarks manually on the site,
    the core of Blocmarks ability comes from remote data creation.
</p>

<p> To use Blocmarks functionality, you simply need to send an email to postmaster@app088d023c61fd4c2eaf20a535e1147a4e.mailgun.org. <thead>
    Important Details are as follows:
    <li> <strong>Your email</strong>: Blocmarks will search for your email it its database. If you are not yet a user, Blocmarks will create an account with your email with the default password Blocmarks2016 (remember to change it when you log in!) </li>
    <li> <strong>Email Subject</strong>: Blocmarks will search its database for a topic with the same name. If no such topic exists, it will create a new topic with whatever you typed into the subject. </li>
    <li> <strong>Email Body</strong>: Blocmarks will create a new bookmark with the data within. Please ensure that you use proper urls, or Blocmarks will just place a string under the topic, and no image will be generated. </li>
